Editing with multiple windows and buffers.		*windows* *buffers*

The commands which have been added to use multiple windows and buffers are
explained here.  Additionally, there are explanations for commands that work
differently when used in combination with more than one window.

3.  Opening and closing a window	|opening-window|
4.  Moving cursor to other windows	|window-move-cursor|
8.  Writing with multiple buffers	|buffer-write|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
3. Opening and closing a window				*opening-window*

CTRL-W s						*CTRL-W_s*
CTRL-W S						*CTRL-W_S*
CTRL-W CTRL-S						*CTRL-W_CTRL-S*
:[N]sp[lit] [+cmd]					*:sp* *:split*
		Split current window in two.  The result is two viewports on
		the same file.  Make new window N high (default is to use half
		the height of the current window).  Reduces the current window
		height to create room (and others, if the 'equalalways' option
		is set).  (Note: CTRL-S does not work on all terminals).  Also
		see |+cmd|.

Closing a window
----------------

CTRL-W c					*CTRL-W_c* *:clo* *:close*
:clo[se][!]	Close current window.  When the 'hidden' option is set, or
		when the buffer was changed and the [!] is used, the buffer
		becomes hidden (unless there is another window editing it).
		This command fails when:
		- There is only one window on the screen.
		- When 'hidden' is not set, [!] is not used, the buffer has
		  changes, and there is no other window on this buffer.
		Changes to the buffer are not written and won't get lost, so
		this is a "safe" command.

CTRL-W o						*CTRL-W_o*
CTRL-W CTRL-O					*CTRL-W_CTRL-O* *:on* *:only*
:on[ly][!]	Make the current window the only one on the screen.  All other
		windows are closed.
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.

4. Moving cursor to other windows			*window-move-cursor*

CTRL-W <Down>					*CTRL-W_<Down>*
CTRL-W CTRL-J					*CTRL-W_CTRL-J* *CTRL-W_j*
CTRL-W j	Move cursor to Nth window below current one.  Uses the cursor
		position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W <Up>					*CTRL-W_<Up>*
CTRL-W CTRL-K					*CTRL-W_CTRL-K* *CTRL-W_k*
CTRL-W k	Move cursor to Nth window above current one.  Uses the cursor
		position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W <Left>					*CTRL-W_<Left>*
CTRL-W CTRL-H					*CTRL-W_CTRL-H*
CTRL-W <BS>					*CTRL-W_<BS>* *CTRL-W_h*
CTRL-W h	Move cursor to Nth window left of current one.  Uses the
		cursor position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W <Right>					*CTRL-W_<Right>*
CTRL-W CTRL-L					*CTRL-W_CTRL-L* *CTRL-W_l*
CTRL-W l	Move cursor to Nth window right of current one.  Uses the
		cursor position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W w					*CTRL-W_w* *CTRL-W_CTRL-W*
CTRL-W CTRL-W	Without count: move cursor to window below/right of the
		current one.  If there is no window below or right, go to
		top-left window.
		With count: go to Nth window (windows are numbered from
		top-left to bottom-right).  To obtain the window number see
		|bufwinnr()| and |winnr()|.  When N is larger than the number
		of windows go to the last window.

						*CTRL-W_W*
CTRL-W W	Without count: move cursor to window above/left of current
		one.  If there is no window above or left, go to bottom-right
		window.  With count: go to Nth window, like with CTRL-W w.

CTRL-W t					*CTRL-W_t* *CTRL-W_CTRL-T*
CTRL-W CTRL-T	Move cursor to top-left window.

CTRL-W b					*CTRL-W_b* *CTRL-W_CTRL-B*
CTRL-W CTRL-B	Move cursor to bottom-right window.

CTRL-W p					*CTRL-W_p* *CTRL-W_CTRL-P*
CTRL-W CTRL-P	Go to previous (last accessed) window.

==============================================================================
8. Writing with multiple buffers			*buffer-write*

							*:wa* *:wall*
:wa[ll]		Write all changed buffers.  Buffers without a file name or
		which are readonly are not written.
