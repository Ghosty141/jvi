Folding						*Folding* *folding*

jVi supports a few fold commands

2. Fold commands	|fold-commands|
3. Fold options		|fold-options|
4. Behavior of folds	|fold-behavior|

{Vi has no Folding}
{not available when compiled without the +folding feature}

==============================================================================
2. Fold commands				*fold-commands* *E490*

All folding commands start with "z".  Hint: the "z" looks like a folded piece
of paper, if you look at it from the side.
