        Known differences between jVi and Vim
        -------------------------------------
        -------------------------------------

Applicable vim documentation is provided. Most things that do not apply have
been removed from this documentation. It still needs further cleanup, but it
does provide a good description of implemented commands and operation.

Check the file NORMAL_COMMANDS for a complete list of vim normal mode
commands. Each command is marked as "works", "not yet" or "not planned".  Over
100 normal mode commands are implemented.

Only a few ":" commands are implemented.

A mouse click will stop insert mode. Otherwise the mouse does not participate
in commands. Java selections, i.e. highlighted text, are not used in any way.
If there is a java selection, enter either v, V or ^V to convert to
visual mode selection. With a visual mode selection, enter ^G to
convert it to java selection.

The vim 'cpoptions' "u", do vi compatible single level undo, is not
supported. The u (undo) and Ctlr-R (redo) are always multi-level.

Not all of vim's extensions to the "z" command are implemented.
