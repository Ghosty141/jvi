<b>&quot;jVi Core&quot; WishList 04/17/07</b>
<p>
</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>visual block mode, targeted for 1.0</li>
      <li><tt>!</tt>, <tt>:!</tt> family of commands, targeted for 1.0</li>
      <li>highlight search, targeted for 1.0</li>
      <li>move cursor in input mode, targeted for 1.0</li>
      <li>modelines option, now that there is a :set command</li>
      <li>add more options to the :set command</li>
      <li>better mouse integration</li>
    </ul>

<b>&quot;jVi in NetBeans&quot; WishList 04/17/07</b>
<p>
</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>an undo/redo that works like vim
        <br/>This probably requires some NetBeans API work
      </li>
      <li><tt>:e</tt> code completion for open and/or project files
        <br/> Probably want different commands, one for open files and
        the other for general and/or project files. Maybe bring up an open file
        browser for project files.
      </li>
      <li><tt>:make</tt>
        <br/>Need extensions for selected project, single file, project being
        edited.
      </li>
      <li>Debug commands
        <br/>single step, run until this line, etc. I was thinking of using
        <tt>:x</tt> to start a debug command.
        One "special" command I'd
        personall like to set up is "tracepoint": this is a
        breakpoint on the current line that doesn't stop any threads, but prints
        the current method/linenumber; it could bring up the customize
        breakpoint dialog with everything setup up so that a &lt;RET&gt; would close
        the dialog; but the caret would be positioned so that you could enter
        additional info to display
      </li>
      <li><tt>Ctrl-W</tt> window manipulation commands
        <br/>jVi is set up for a few these if the platform supports them. I
        haven't seen a NetBeans API for this type of functionality. I haven't
        asked yet either.
      </li>
      <li>clean up interactions with code folding</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
