<h1 id="Introduction" style="text-align: center" >jVi - vi editor clone</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the jVi home page. Currently this page has some random
thoughts/comments, serve as the user documentation and get you
<br/>to
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvi/files/" target="_top">
  DOWNLOAD jVi for NetBeans</a>
and <a href="#Download">jVi for JBuilder download info</a>.
There is news and information about
the different applications in which jVi is integrated. 
</p>
<font size="+1">
<p>
Note that jVi is a port of a major chunk of vim. It is not like many IDE
keybindings where, for example, I often hear stuff like "its similar to emacs
but not the same".
jVi is the same, try <code>:.,$s/([^ ]*) (.*$)/\2 \1/</code>
(you can set options so you don't need to escape '(' and other 
metacharacters in regular expressions) or
<code>"*2d3w</code> which deletes 6 words stashing them in the system
clipboard or <code>y%</code> or ... And, yes, "." works.
There is stuff missing, but if what's
there doesn't work like vi/vim then its a bug (or a feature).
</p>
<p>
And jVi has <a href="doc_notes">features not found in vim</a>.

After a 5 year hiatus from Java, there's some personal projects I want to
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org" target="_top">
        <img SRC="images/BuiltForNetbeans.png"
        ALT="Built for NetBeans"
        height="75" width="150" align="right" border="0"></a>
work on, 3D visualization of Sacred Geometry is one of them and there may be
some RCP. I wanted to use
an open source IDE, not JBuilder, and that means another port of jVi. I looked
at Eclipse, but the burden of SWT
was more than I would bear. Looking through some NetBeans mail archives
I was led to some work that Rich Unger did a few years ago to integrate jVi
into NetBeans; many thanks Rich. He
said he put it together in an evening; it was a good proof of concept, there
was vi behavior in the editor, but it was unusable for work. But that
starting point saved me countless hours. And now, with an editor I want to use,
I can start learning about NetBeans and get my personal projects going.

<a id="Why_jVi"></a>
<h1 class="MainSec00Font">Why jVi?</h1>
<p> jVi is motivated by my frustration with the editors provided
by desktop apps, from mail readers to IDE's.&nbsp; The advent of java based
desktop apps, and the ability to extend them, makes it possible to put
together a vi which easily integrates into multiple disparate apps. A goal,
over time, is to make jVi fully functional with good performance. However
i believe there will always be performance limitations with jVi and expect to
continue using "native" editors for heavy duty tasks.
</p>
<p>jVi is patterned after
<a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>.
<a href="http://www.vim.org">
        <img SRC="images/vim_moolenaar_vimlogo.gif"
        ALT="Vim Logo" height=60 width=125 align=right border="0"></a>
Vim is freely available charityware and running on a large number of
platforms, including for instance amiga and mac. Check out the site for
general vi pointers and documentation. jVi is a small subset of vim. Some
source code in jVi is taken from vim and modified to work in the java
environment.  The user documentation is almost exclusively from vim, only
modified to remove things that are not applicable.
</p>

<h1 id="Quick_Start" class="MainSec00Font">Quick Start</h1>
<p>
There is a list of all <a href="NORMAL_COMMANDS">
normal mode commands
</a>
supported by vim. In this list, the over 100 commands supported by jVi
are marked. The <code>'</code> and <code>"</code> for marks and
named buffers work as expected;
a <code>*</code> is a named buffer for the clipboard.
There are a few <a href="COLON_COMMANDS">colon commands</a>
available, try <tt>:g/foo/s/bar/baz/gp</tt>, and also see the platform
specific documentation for additional colon commands.
    There are several <a href="vimhelp/insert.txt">insert mode commands</a>
supported. And jVi sports a Ctrl-&lt; and Ctrl-&gt; in insert mode
to align with '('s on the previous line.
</p><p>
If you are a vi or vim user you can
just start using jVi and be comfortable. You may occasionally see
a "not implemented" message.
There are a variety of options available. Check the Reference Doc
for more information. There are also some
<a href="doc_notes">jVi only features</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Text search</b> commands, for example <code>"/"</code> and <code>"?"</code>,
use the vim regular expression syntax, see
<A HREF="pattern.txt">Searching and Patterns</A>. If you don't like escaping
characters like <code>"("</code> and <code>"|"</code> in patterns there are
options to change that. The java.util.regex package is used and
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">
javadocs describe the pattern syntax</a>.
</p>
<p>
jVi is embedded; where applicable, the
standard commands, for example "<code>:w</code>", are directed to the
application for execution.
There may be capabilities available
while editing that are provided by the primary application. For example,
when jVi is used within
<a href="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder" target="_top"> JBuilder</a>,
or
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target="_top">NetBeans</a>,
code insight works while editing.
The platform specific documentation about jVi should be consulted.
</p><p>
Almost all of the reference documentation is derived from the vim help files.
A subset of the vim help files are included. They are
modified to remove things that are not applicable. This is
detailed information on the commands and operation.
