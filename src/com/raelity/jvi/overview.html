jVi is vi-vim editor clone. The intention is that jVi be embedded in
various applications, for example IDEs and news/mail readers. To meet this
goal, jVi is organized to make it easy to plug into an application.
The package {@link com.raelity.jvi} is the
primary editing engine. It processes all the vi commands and performs
text manipullations. It gets access to its environment through a series
of interfaces. The package {@link com.raelity.jvi.swing} has most of the
substance of a port of jVi to the swing package. {@link com.raelity.jvi.cmd}
is a port of jVi that provides a standalone editor. It can be used in a pinch
when no better alternative, such as a native vim port, is available.
